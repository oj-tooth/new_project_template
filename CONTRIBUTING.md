## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We are committed to providing a welcoming environment for contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) to manage dependencies and development tasks. Pixi handles all language runtimes and packages, so you do not need to install anything else manually.

Install Pixi by following the [official installation instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation):

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
iwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
```

### Setting Up the Environment

Install all project dependencies into an isolated Pixi environment:

```bash
pixi install
```

This reads `pixi.toml` and resolves all dependencies automatically. You do not need to activate any environment manually — Pixi handles this for each command.

---

## Development Workflow

All common development tasks are defined as Pixi tasks in `pixi.toml`. Run any task with:

```bash
pixi run <task-name>
```

Key tasks include:

| Task | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Unit Testing | `pixi run tests` | Run unit tests using pytest |
| Ruff Linting | `pixi run lint` | Run code linting using Ruff |
| Ruff Linting | `pixi run fix` | Run code linting and auto-fix issues using Ruff |
| Ruff Formatting | `pixi run format` | Run code formatting using Ruff |
| Preview Docs | `pixi run preview-docs` | Run local preview of Documentation |

To see all available tasks:

```bash
pixi task list
```

---

## Running Tests

Run the full unit test suite with:

```bash
pixi run tests
```

Please ensure all tests pass before opening a pull request. If you are adding new functionality, include corresponding tests.

---

## Code Style

This project follows standard code style conventions. If linting or formatting tasks are defined, run them before committing:

```bash
pixi run lint
pixi run format
```

   ```

2. **Make your changes**, following the code style guidelines above.

3. **Add or update tests** to cover your changes.

4. **Run the test suite** and confirm everything passes:

   ```bash

   ```

5. **Commit your changes** with a clear, descriptive commit message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add support for XYZ"
   ```

6. **Push** your branch and open a pull request against `main`.
